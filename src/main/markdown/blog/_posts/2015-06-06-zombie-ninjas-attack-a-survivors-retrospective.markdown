This is an example blog from [Octopress](http://octopress.org) using a suggested post from the [docs](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/).

    If you want a way to host a private static site, consider [Hiram Pages](https://www.hirampages.com)

You can include variables available in the other HTML files here as well.  For example, this build's git revision is %{{ gitRevShort }}%.

Also, this build script is pre-configured to use the **slug** front-matter variable to override the slug

%{{ extraInfo }}%
