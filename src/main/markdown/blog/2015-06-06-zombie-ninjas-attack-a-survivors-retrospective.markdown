This is an example blog from [Octopress](http://octopress.org) using a suggested post from the [docs](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/).

Imagine your blog or writing available only to a select few instead of the full internet...

You can include variables available in the other HTML files here as well.  For example, this build's git revision is %{{ gitRevShort }}%.

Also, this build script is pre-configured to use the **slug** front-matter variable to override the slug

%{{ extraInfo }}%

The above h2 is populated by a front-matter variable referenced within this markdown as a swig variable.
